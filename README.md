# Layout-Optimization-Analysis
In this project, I conducted a data-driven analysis to evaluate the impact of a new trial store layout implemented in selected retail locations. The goal was to determine whether the layout should be rolled out to all stores.  Using historical sales data, I identified suitable control stores that closely matched the trial stores based on key metrics such as total sales revenue, number of customers, and average transactions per customer. I then compared these metrics between the trial and control stores during a defined trial period.  The analysis revealed that the trial layout led to improved performance in some stores, with increases in sales, customer numbers, and transactions. Based on these results, I provided a recommendation on whether to implement the layout across all stores.  Key skills demonstrated in this project include data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization, as well as the ability to draw actionable business insights from data.
